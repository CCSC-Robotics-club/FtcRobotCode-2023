perhaps we can add a super sonic or inferred sensor that senses distance above
# grabbing and dropping not precise
## problem description
the robot is not precise when trying to grab or score sleeves, both in auto and manual stage

## my solution
perhaps we can add a super sonic or inferred sensor that senses distance of the obstacle ahead of the robot when the robot wants to place the sleeve, 
it should rotate near the tower and calculate the rotation where the distance to the obstacel is the closed, 
that would be the direction of the tower, and that distance will indicate how far the tower is from the robot
